I made a new branch, "2019-0309" (named after the date).
I made a new text file, "experiment" with random text.
I added and  commit  the "experiment" file.

I  checkout  master branch, "master".
I made a new text file, "experiment" with different random text.
I added and  commit  the "experiment" file in "master" branch.

I  checkout  "2019-0309" branch.
I  merge "2019-0309" and got message like 'nothing to merge'.

I  checkout  "master" branch.
I  merge  "2019-0309" and got message like 'conflict - fatal - resolve'.

Intending to edit the two files to be similar, I try to  checkout  "2019-0309" but it won't change branches, and gives message "fix conflict first".

I used  git reset --merge  to stop the  merge  process.  That worked -- thanks stackoverflow.  (And now I need to learn "git fetch origin" and "git reset origin" and "git rebase origin".)

I  git rm experiment  to remove the "experiment" file from the "master" branch.  Now I'm typing what I did in the "experiment" file in the "2019-0309" branch.  But I'm going to rename this file:  learning-git-2019-0309.txt.

The thing that amazes me is that the "experiment" file existed in two versions in the same directory.  The version I saw depended on what branch I had checked out ("master" or "2019-0309").  That's amazing.  I guess it's some kind of temp file magic.

The current adventure (as of 2019-03-18):  ex6 and ex6-sd were done in branch "2019-0317-ex6", which also is live on GitHub (after I pushed from GitShell).  I'm done with 2019-0317-ex6 -- already merged into master.  So, I'm going to delete branch 2019-0317-ex6.  What will that do to the branch on GitHub?  (I will also put this question in the "learning-git-2019-0309.txt" file.)

So, Git refused to delete the branch bc I had not pushed the most recent commit to GitHub.  (I think.)  I was editing this file on "master", so could not checkout 2019-0317-ex6 until I'd first committed "master".  On 2019-0317-ex6, I pushed; back to master, I deleted 2019-0317-ex6 locally; it still exists on GitHub.  But it looks like I'll be able to delete it easily, by clicking the red garbage can icon.  I'll have to read up on best ways to manage branches.

2019-03-20T01:03-07:00	On the Chromebook, I did Exercise 7, but couldn't push it to GitHub because I didn't have OpenSSH set up.  Working on that.  Meanwhile, I don't want to dup the work, so I'm going to skip the ex7 Study Drills for now, and move on the Gateway to Exercise 8.  This will be good, bc it will give me practice managing multiple branches on different machines.

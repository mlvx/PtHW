# Study Drills

# Non-numbered SD (as of 2019-04-16, thisfile renamed from 'ex4-sd.py'
#	to 'ex4-sd0.py' to match what's in other file comments (specifically
#	ex4-sd1.py; there may be others):
#	When Shaw first wrote this program, there was a typo.  Errmsg was:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#        File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module>
#          average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
#      NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined
#
# Explain this error, using line numbers.
#
# Shaw made a typographical error.  On line 8, he meant to type 
# the variable name "carpool_capacity" 
# but instead typed "car_pool_capacity".
# The extra underscore in the variable name meant the Python interpreter
# couldn't find the intended variable to use when it was trying to 
# calculate "average_passengers_per_car".
#
# Interestingly, there's a second typo in line 8, also a variable name.
# The variable "passenger" is not defined.  Shaw should have typed
# "passengers" there.
#
# Line 9 is a copy of line 8, with "car_pool_capacity" changed to
# "carpool_capacity".  Running it (with line 8 commented out) yields a 
# similar error:
#
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#      File "ex4-sd.py", line 9, in <module>
#          average_passengers_per_car = carpool_capacity / passenger
#          NameError: name 'passenger' is not defined
#
# Finally, we see Shaw made another error.  Line 10 is a copy of line 8, 
# with both  variables names corrected.  "car_pool_capacity" is replaced by
# "carpool_capacity",  and "passenger" is replaced with the correct variable
# name "passengers".  When we  uncomment line 10 and run, we get that "We
# need to put about 1.33333333333 in each car"  which is incorrect.  Line 11
# has the corrected value:  "average_passengers_per_car = passengers /
# cars_driven" which yields "about 3 in each car".

# SD1:  See ex4-sd1.py (variables -- floating-point?).
# SD2:  See ex4-sd2.py (more about floating-point numbers).
# SD3:  See ex4-sd3.py (comments above variable assignments -- interesting!).
# SD4:  Name of "=" char; and  =  assigns a label to a var.  No separate file.
# SD5:  Name of "_" char.  No separate file.
# SD6:  Use Python interactively as a calculator.  Use variable names to do
#	calculations.  Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
# Done.

# 2019-04-16	Edited to reflect conventionally preferred style, as at:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
# And, fixed some typos I noticed.  And changed the name of this file to
# ex4-sd0.py.  (Which is what I'd thought I'd named it.)

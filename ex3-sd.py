# Study Drills

# SD1.  Above each line, write a comment explaining what the line does.
# No, I'm not doing that; useless comments.  I'll do two of them, and trace 
# the orders of operaitons.

# SD2.  Use Python as an interactive calcluator.
# Done.  Fun.

# SD3.  Find something you need to calculate.  Write a new .py file to do it.
# See ex3-sd3-weight.py.

# SD4.  Notice the math seems "wrong" -- no fractions, only whole numbers.  
#        Research "floating point" numbers.
# This ended up being more interesting than I'd expected.  It's an issue with
# binary arithmetic.  Just as in decimal, you can't really represent 1/3
# accurately (0.3 repeating), in binary you can't rep decimal 1/10 accurately.
# You can only do an approximation.  You get 53 bits of approximation -- good
# enough for most things but can have unexpected results (rounding etc.).
# https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html

# SD5.  Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbesr so it's more accurate 
#        (hint: 20.0 is floating point).
# See ex3-sd5-floating.py.

# Study Drills

# SD0.  When Shaw first wrote this program, there was a typo.  Errmsg was...
# See file ex4-sd0.py.

# SD1.  Shaw used "4.0" for var. "space_in_a_car".  Is that necessary?  What 
#        happens if it were simply "4"?
# Var. "space_in_a_car" is defined in line 2, and used in line 7 to calculate
# the var.  # "carpool_capacity".  Defining it at 4.0 makes it a floating point
# number (aka # "float"), which is not necessary for the "carpool_capacity"
# calculation, because the # calculation is a multiplication.  (It *would*
# be necessary if the calculation were a # division.)

# Study Drills

# SD1.  Above each line, write a comment explaining what the line does.
# No, I'm not doing that; useless comments.  I'll do two of them, and trace the orders of operaitons.

# SD2.  Use Python as an interactive calcluator.
# Done.  Fun.

# SD3.  Find something you need to calculate, and write a new .py file to do it.
# See ex3-sd3-weight.py.

# SD4.  Notice the math seems "wrong" -- no fractions, only whole numbers.  Research "floating point" numbers.

# SD5.  Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbesr so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is floating point).
# See ex3-sd5-floating.py.

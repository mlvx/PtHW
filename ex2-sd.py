# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."

# Study Drills

# SD1. Find out if you were right about what the # does, and make sure
#      you know what it's called.
# Yes; comment (characters following the # are not processed by the 
# python interpreter).

# SD2. Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backward.  Start at
#      the last line, and check each word in reverse.
# Done.

# SD3. Did you find more mistakes?  Fix them.
# No mistakes this time 'round.

# SD4. Read what you typed previously out loud, including saying each
#      character by its name.  Did you find more mistakes?  Fix them.
# Done.  Reading character-by-character aloud is actually kind of tiring.

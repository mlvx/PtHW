# Ex. 10 - Study Drills
# SD1: Memorize the escape sequences, with flash cards.
# In progress.

# SD2: Use ''' instead of """ on lines 5 and 10.  Can you see why
#      that might be better?
# There's no difference in the output.  Maybe  '''  is easier to 
# spot than  """  when you're reading code?  I'll have to try both
# for a while, and see if I have a preference.

# SD3: Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a
# more complex format.
# SD4: Combine  %r  with double-quote and single-quote escapes, 
# and print them.  Compare  %r  with  %s.  Notice how  %r  prints
# it the way you'd write in a your file, and  %s  displays it in
# more conventionally.

# Variables to print
x = "\n" # These vars must precede lines that call it.

Learn Python the Hard Way
The classic by Zed Shaw.  There will be code!
2018-11-07  Did ex1.py but bumbled the Gitness of it all.
2018-11-08  Read about and practiced with Python lists, so that counts as learning Python the hard way, even though it's not from the book.  Still bumbling Git.
2019-03-08  Rebooting this, from ex1.py.
2019-03-08T04:00-0800	I should have timestamped; will do hence.  String in Vim is :r!date -I'minutes' .  Finished ex1 and ex2, with study drills.
2019-03-09  Did ex3 with study drills (math operations); forgot to timestamp.  Had some hands-on practice merging branches with conflicts.
2019-03-10T14:29-0700	Working on LPtHW, exercise 4, intro to variables.  Using Vim's "ctrl-r" autocomplete features to get var names right -- so nice.
2019-03-10T17:22-0700	Done for today.  Interesting -- choosing whether variables are integer or floating-point can have repercussions later.
2019-03-16T04:23-0700	Forgot to timestamp when I started a couple hours ago.  Did ex5-sd3 -- all the format characters.  There actually are several I'd forgotten about, like %u and %U for Unicode, %x and %X for hexadecimal, etc.  Next:  Do ex5-sd4, converting Shaw's measurements into metric.
2019-03-18T01:46-0700	Earlier, did ex6; forgot to update README.  Hm; given the existence of Git Log, perhaps README is not the proper place to track progress.  I may revamp this.
2019-03-18T01:47-0700	Currently working on ex6 study drills.  I dislike adding comments to each line, but I do perceive the educational value -- forces me to actually think about some of the lines.
2019-03-18T02:59-0700 	Finished the ex6 study drills.  Text strings, strings in variables, strings inside of strings, concatenating strings with "+".  A file was renamed from "ex6-sd2.py" to "ex6-sd234.py".  The current adventure:  ex6 and ex6-sd were done in branch "2019-0317-ex6", which also is live on GitHub (after I pushed from GitShell).  I'm done with 2019-0317-ex6 -- already merged into master.  So, I'm going to delete branch 2019-0317-ex6.  What will that do to the branch on GitHub?  (I will also put this question in the "learning-git-2019-0309.txt" file.)

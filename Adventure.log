Zed Shaw uses "Adventure" and "Zork" as examples of interactivity
possible via mechanisms like  raw_input  and one of the Study Drill
activities was to find and play Adventure or Zork.  Adventure 
is already installed on Window Subsystem for Linux, so playing it
was easy to begin.

Game 1, began 2019-04-20 and 04-21, resumed 2019-04-22.
Died 2019-04-22.
"You scored 48 out of a possible 350, using 185 turns."
My score decreased, because when I paused it, I had 54 points.
I will play again, eventually.

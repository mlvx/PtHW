I'm working on Exercise 12, Study Drill 4.
I'm supposed to be reading the PyDoc documentation
on the builtin function "open".  I'm a little 
sidetracked now, trying to get get "file.readline()"
to work.

I am trying to use  "bar=file.readline(ex1.py)"  to
read in some of the ex.py file and store it in the 
variable called "bar".  I got an error "name 'ex1' 
is not defined" which makes me think the filename, 
including a dot, is mucking things up.  (Have to 
escape punctuation / special characters?)  Hence
this file, "testingfile", with no dot in the 
filename.  We'll see what happens. 

Ok, the dot didn't matter; "name 'testingfile' is
not defined".  Maybe it's supposed to be:
   bar=testingfile.readline()

# Defines "cars_driven" to be the same as "drivers".  Interesting, because
# we could use "drivers" instead of defining a new variable.  I wonder about
# the advantages of each approach, when later maintaining code.

# Defines new var., assigns value by calculation, using two previously defined and assigned vars.  
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car

# Defines new var., assigns value by calculation, using two previously defined and assigned vars.  
# In this instance, a division calculation, the previous assignment choices (integer or floating-point)
# can have an effect on the number that is displayed.  90 / 30 = 3 ; but suppose "passengers" had a 
# value of, say, 89?  That would lead to "We need to put about 2 in each car".
# If "passengers" has value "89.0", we get "We need to put about 2.96666666667 in each car".
# (WTH is .966667 of a passenger?  Chop off a finger??)
# So, the sensible way to do this would be:  Assign the variable as a floating point; perform the 
# calculation; round the answer to something that makes sense to a human.

# Study Drills

# SD1.  Is it necessary to use "4.0" for the var. "space_in_a_car"?
# No, because it's used in a multiplication, not a division (line 7).

SD3.  Write comments above each of the variable assignments.
Um... Why?  Ok, I'll do it.
Ok, that was more interesting than I expected.

SD4.  Make sure you know what "=" is called (equals), and that it's making names for things.
Ok.  (Not making a new file for that.)

SD5.  Remember that "_" is an underscore character.
Ok.  (Not making a new file for that either.)
